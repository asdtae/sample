This project demonstrates the use of radio signals and a microcontroller to
provide a live video feed by analyzing the received signals. Utilizing three
radio transmitters and one receiver, the system determines the participant's
location and converts the radio waves into a corresponding video frame.

## Features

- **Live Video Feed**: Real-time video feed generated from radio signal analysis.
- **Accurate Location Tracking**: Uses three radio transmitters and a receiver for precise participant location determination.
- **QR Code Integration**: Scan QR codes to initialize and synchronize participant location tracking.
- **Microcontroller-Based**: Efficient signal processing and location algorithms run on a microcontroller.

## How It Works

1. **Radio Transmission**: Three radio transmitters emit signals continuously.
2. **Signal Reception**: A receiver captures these signals and sends the data to the microcontroller.
3. **Location Algorithm**: The microcontroller processes the received signals to determine the participant's location.
4. **Video Frame Generation**: The location data is converted into a video frame, providing a live feed of the participantâ€™s position.
5. **QR Code Initialization**: Participants scan a QR code to start and synchronize the tracking process.
